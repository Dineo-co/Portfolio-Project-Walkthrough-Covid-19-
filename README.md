# Covid-19 Data Analysis Project using Python
This project uses Python to study Covid-19 data, like the number of cases, recoveries, and deaths, collected from different sources. It helps us understand how the virus spread and the impact of measures like vaccinations and lockdowns.
## What it Does:
Data Handling:
Cleans and organizes data using Python tools like Pandas and NumPy
Fixes missing or messy data to make it ready for analysis.
Data Visualization:
Creates charts and graphs using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to show trends and patterns clearly.
Key Insights:
Tracks how Covid-19 cases changed over time.
Looks at how vaccinations or lockdowns affected the spread of the virus.
Studies the link between cases and deaths to understand the severity of the virus.
Comparisons:
Compares data from before and after vaccinations started to see how they helped.
